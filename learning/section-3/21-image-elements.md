- **Image element**: Similar to the anchor tag, 

    ```< img src = "url" />```

- The main component of an image tag that renders the image is the attribute **src** which is **source**, after the equal sign, the value is going to be the **location** of the image
- However, unlike the anchor tag, it doesn't have a closing tag, it's a self-closing tag, also known as a ***void element***, which is already mentioned like ***horizontal rule*** or ***brear rule***
- **Example**:
    
    ``` < img src = "https://picsum.photos/200" />```

    **Result**:

    <img src = "https://picsum.photos/200"/>

- The other attribute for an image tag that's super important and one that you should always have is the ***alt*** attribute which stands for Alternavtive Text Description:

    ``` < img src = "https://picsum.photos/200" alt = "attribute" />```

- This serves for people who've got the abmornal functionalities to read or write and provides the environment for some apps will approach to the attribute of the image and provide some easier way for them to get informed.
