- **Anchor element**: There will be an opening tag < a > and closing tag < /a >

    ```< a >This is a link < /a >```

- We need to add an additional *attribute* which goes in opening tag.

    ```< a href="http://www.google.com">This is a link< /a >```

- **HTML Atrributes**: The structure of the attribute will be:

    ``` <tag attribute=value>Content</tag> ```

- There is as many attributes as we want, make sure to seperate them with a space and go into the opening tag.

    ``` <tag attribute=value anotherattribute=value>Content</tag> ```
