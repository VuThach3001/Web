Wrapping text using float and clear.

**Float:**

The format would be like:
```
element {
    float: left;
}
...
<img .../>
<p>text...</p>
```
- As soon as this CSS is applied, thet the text will begin to wrap around the image.

**Clear:**
- Clear any responsibility to wrap around things that are floating.
