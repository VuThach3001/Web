**1. Values and Variables**
- **Values**: The actual data or information that can be stored in a program. Examples include numbers, strings, booleans, etc.
```javascript
let js = "amazing";
console.log(40 + 8 + 23 - 10);
console.log("Jonas");
console.log(js);
```
- In the example above, `"amazing"` is a value of type string. The numbers `40`, `8`, `23`, and `10` are values of type number. and `Jonas` is also a string value.

- **Variables**: Named containers that hold values. They allow us to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in our programs.
  - In above example, `js` is a variable that holds the string value `"amazing"`.
  - Variables can be declared using keywords like `let`, `const`, or `var`.
  - We can print the `js` variable instead of the string directly, which makes our code more flexible and easier to maintain.

**2. Naming Conventions**
- camelCase: The first word is lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter (e.g., `myVariableName`).
- Variables should be descriptive and meaningful to enhance code readability.
```javascript
let firstName = "Jonas";
let lastName = "Schmedtmann";
let age = 2037 - 1991;
```
- Or you can use underscores to separate words (e.g., `my_variable_name`). This is less common in JavaScript but still valid and used in some other languages such as Ruby and Python or C.

**3. Some rules for naming variables**
- Variable names must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
- They cannot start with a number.
- No spaces are allowed in variable names.
- JavaScript is case-sensitive, so `myVariable` and `myvariable` would be considered different variables.
- Reserved keywords (like `let`, `const`, `var`, `if`, `else`, etc.) cannot be used as variable names.
- We should not start the variables with uppercase letters. This is a convention to differentiate between variables and classes.
- We only use variables with **capital letters** for constants that never change.
